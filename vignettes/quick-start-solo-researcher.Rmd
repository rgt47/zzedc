# Getting ZZedc Running in 10 Minutes (Solo Researcher)

You're a clinical researcher with a study. You need electronic data capture. You want it **local, simple, and fast**.

This guide gets you from "nothing" to "collecting data" in about 10 minutes.

---

## What You'll Need

- **R installed** (version 4.0 or later)
- **RStudio** (optional but recommended)
- **~5 MB disk space**
- **Basic study information** (name, PI details, password)

**Time estimate: 10 minutes total**

---

## Step 1: Install ZZedc (2 minutes)

Open R or RStudio and run:

```r
install.packages("zzedc")
```

After installation completes, load the library:

```r
library(zzedc)
```

You should see:
```
> library(zzedc)
ZZedc - Electronic Data Capture System loaded successfully
```

---

## Step 2: Initialize Your Project (5 minutes)

Run this command in your R console:

```r
zzedc::init()
```

You'll see a welcome message:
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║          ZZedc Project Initialization                    ║
║          Electronic Data Capture System Setup             ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Welcome to ZZedc Setup!
This will guide you through setting up your research study.

Step 1: Study Information
────────────────────────────────────────────
Study Name (e.g., 'Depression Treatment Trial'):
```

### What to Enter

**Study Name:**
```
Depression Treatment Trial
```
(Any name that describes your study)

**Protocol ID:**
```
DEPR-2024-001
```
(Your institutional protocol number)

**Principal Investigator Name:**
```
Dr. Jane Smith
```

**PI Email:**
```
jane.smith@university.edu
```

**Target Enrollment:**
```
50
```
(How many participants you plan to enroll)

**Study Phase:**
```
Phase 2
```
(Options: Pilot, Phase1, Phase2, Phase3, Phase4, Observational)

### Step 2: Admin Account

This is YOUR login account for managing the system.

**Admin Username:**
```
jane_smith
```
(Your preferred login name - no spaces)

**Your Full Name:**
```
Jane Smith
```

**Your Email:**
```
jane.smith@university.edu
```

**Admin Password:**
```
MySecurePassword2024!
```
(Must be 8+ characters, mix of letters/numbers/symbols)

**Confirm Password:**
```
MySecurePassword2024!
```
(Type it again)

### Step 3: Security Configuration

The system will generate a **security salt** - a unique key that encrypts passwords.

**Important:** You'll see something like:
```
A unique security salt has been generated for your system:
  a7f9e2c4d1b3f8a6e9d2c5b8f1a4e7d0

⚠️  IMPORTANT: Save this salt in a secure location!
   If you lose it, you cannot recover your passwords.

Have you saved the security salt? (yes/no):
```

**Copy that salt somewhere safe:**
- Email it to yourself
- Save in password manager
- Write it down
- **Just don't lose it!**

Then answer:
```
yes
```

**Session Timeout:**
```
30
```
(Minutes of inactivity before automatic logout)

**Enforce HTTPS:**
```
no
```
(For local use, no = fine. For internet, yes = recommended)

### Step 4: Confirmation

You'll see a summary:
```
Summary of your configuration:

  Study Name: Depression Treatment Trial
  Protocol ID: DEPR-2024-001
  PI: Dr. Jane Smith (jane.smith@university.edu)
  Target Enrollment: 50
  Study Phase: Phase 2
  Admin Username: jane_smith
  Session Timeout: 30 minutes
  Enforce HTTPS: No

Create project with these settings? (yes/no):
```

Type:
```
yes
```

---

## Step 3: Launch Your System (1 minute)

After setup completes, you'll see:
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║          ✓ ZZedc Project Created Successfully!            ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Project Location: ./Depression_Treatment_Trial

Next Steps:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. Set environment variable:
   export ZZEDC_SALT='a7f9e2c4d1b3f8a6e9d2c5b8f1a4e7d0'

2. Launch your ZZedc application:
   Rscript Depression_Treatment_Trial/launch_app.R

3. Open your browser to:
   http://localhost:3838
```

In your R console, run:

```r
# Set the security salt (copy from setup output)
Sys.setenv(ZZEDC_SALT = "a7f9e2c4d1b3f8a6e9d2c5b8f1a4e7d0")

# Launch the application
launch_zzedc()
```

Your browser will open automatically to `http://localhost:3838`

---

## Step 4: Login (30 seconds)

You'll see the ZZedc login screen.

Enter the credentials from Step 2:
- **Username:** jane_smith
- **Password:** MySecurePassword2024!

Click **Login**

## Troubleshooting

### "Port 3838 already in use"
Another app is using port 3838.
- Wait a moment and try again, OR
- Stop the other app, OR
- Restart R and try again

### "Database error"
ZZedc can't access the database file.
- Make sure you're in the correct directory
- Check that the `data/zzedc.db` file exists
- Ensure you have write permissions

### "Login failed"
Check:
- Did you type the username correctly? (no spaces)
- Did you type the password correctly? (case-sensitive)
- Did you remember the password from setup?

### "Lost the security salt"
Unfortunately, it can't be recovered.
Options:
1. You can still use ZZedc (salt is only for new passwords)
2. To reset passwords, contact support
3. Restart setup with `zzedc::init()` in a new directory

---

## Keeping Your Data Safe

### Regular Backups
Do this weekly:
1. Admin Dashboard → Backup & Restore
2. Click "Create Backup Now"
3. Download the backup file
4. Store on external drive or cloud

### Password Safety
- Your password is encrypted using the security salt
- Even with the database, your password is safe
- Only change if you suspect compromise

### Data Security
- Database is SQLite (local file)
- All data is stored locally on your machine
- No data sent to cloud (unless you configure)
- You control your data completely
