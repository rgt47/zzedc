# ZZedc Quickstart: Get Running in 5 Minutes

Welcome! This quickstart guide shows you what ZZedc can do and gets you started immediately. No prior experience needed.

## What is ZZedc?

**ZZedc** is a modern Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system that makes it easy to collect, manage, and analyze research data from clinical trials and studies. Think of it as "REDCap's open-source, modern alternative" — built with the latest web technology, designed for teams, and optimized for compliance.

### Why Choose ZZedc?

✅ **Free & Open Source** — No licensing fees, full source code control
✅ **Modern Web Interface** — Built with Bootstrap 5, works on any device
✅ **Secure by Default** — Database authentication, audit trails, GDPR/21 CFR Part 11 ready
✅ **Easy to Deploy** — Local server, cloud, Docker — your choice
✅ **Powerful & Flexible** — Supports any therapeutic area, any study design
✅ **Real-time Validation** — Errors caught immediately during data entry

## Start Here: 3 Simple Steps

### Step 1: Install (30 seconds)

```{r installation}
# Install both packages (zzedc.validation is the validation core)
install.packages("path/to/zzedc.validation_1.0.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
install.packages("path/to/zzedc_1.0.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")

# Load ZZedc
library(zzedc)
```

### Step 2: Launch (10 seconds)

```{r launch}
# Start the application
launch_zzedc()

# Your browser opens automatically at http://localhost:3838
```

### Step 3: Login (20 seconds)

**Default test account:**
- Username: `test`
- Password: `test`

You're in! Welcome to your ZZedc system.

## What You Can Do Right Now

### 📋 Collect Data Safely

Enter patient data with **built-in validation** that prevents errors:

```{r data_validation}
# ZZedc automatically validates:
validation_rules <- list(
  "Age must be 18-120" = "Age validation",
  "Visit date after enrollment" = "Date logic",
  "Required fields completed" = "Completeness",
  "Numeric fields are numbers" = "Type checking",
  "Custom study-specific rules" = "Advanced validation"
)
```

**Live example:** Try entering an age of "999" or a date in the future for a past visit. The system stops you immediately with a clear error message.

### 📊 See Your Data in Real-Time

The **Data Explorer** tab shows:
- Live enrollment tracking with interactive charts
- Detailed data table with filtering and searching
- Missing data flags and quality metrics
- Export any subset for analysis

### 📈 Generate Reports Automatically

Three levels of reporting:

**Report 1: Enrollment Dashboard**
```{r report1}
# Automatically shows:
# - Total subjects enrolled
# - Enrollment by site (if multi-site)
# - Status breakdown (active, completed, withdrawn)
# - Enrollment timeline
```

**Report 2: Quality Control**
```{r report2}
# Automatically flags:
# - Missing data by field
# - Validation errors by subject
# - Duplicate entries
# - Protocol deviations
```

**Report 3: Statistical Summary**
```{r report3}
# Automatically generates:
# - Demographics (age, gender, race, ethnicity)
# - Baseline characteristics
# - Endpoint distributions
# - Safety summaries
```

### 💾 Export Data in Any Format

Download your data as:
- **CSV** — for Excel or R analysis
- **SPSS/SAS** — for advanced statistics
- **RDS** — native R format
- **Analysis-ready datasets** — with computed variables pre-calculated

```{r export_example}
# In the Export tab, select format and download
# Data exports include:
# - Raw data with all variables
# - Derived variables and scores
# - Analysis datasets per protocol
# - Regulatory submission formats
```

## Real-World Example: Your First Study

Let's say you're running a **depression treatment trial** with 50 patients across 2 sites.

### Setup (5 minutes in ZZedc)

1. **Create your study**
   ```{r setup_study}
   study_config <- list(
     name = "Depression Treatment Trial v1.0",
     protocol = "DEPR-2024-001",
     pi = "Dr. Jane Smith",
     sites = c("University Medical Center", "Community Health Clinic"),
     target_enrollment = 50
   )
   ```

2. **Add your team**
   - Dr. Jane Smith (Principal Investigator) — Full access
   - Dr. Mark Johnson (Site PI) — Site 1 data only
   - Sarah Lee (Data Coordinator) — Data entry only
   - Mike Brown (Biostatistician) — Reports only

3. **Define your forms**
   - Demographics (age, gender, race, income)
   - Depression severity (PHQ-9 questionnaire, automatically scored)
   - Treatment assignment (randomization)
   - Weekly visits (baseline, weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12)
   - Adverse events
   - Study completion

### Data Collection (Daily)

Coordinators log in, enter patient data, get instant feedback:

```
Sarah enters Patient 001 data:
✓ Age = 45 (valid)
✓ PHQ-9 score = 18 (valid)
✓ Week 1 visit on schedule ✓ (valid)
⚠️ "Time to feel relief" field missing (warning)
✓ Save successful - 1/50 patients enrolled
```

### Monitoring (Weekly)

PI logs in to check progress:

```
Dashboard shows:
- Enrollment: 18/50 (36%) — on track ✓
- Missing data: 2 subjects missing Week 2 visits
- Quality flags: 1 protocol deviation (visit 3 days late)
- Safety: 2 mild adverse events reported
```

### Analysis (End of Study)

Statistician exports the data:

```{r analysis}
# One click exports analysis-ready dataset:
# - 50 subjects across 2 sites
# - All validated data + computed scores
# - Ready for statistical software
# - Includes audit trail for FDA compliance

analysis_data <- read.csv("depression_trial_export.csv")
head(analysis_data)
# All variables present, properly formatted, complete
```
