# Introduction

The landscape of clinical research data management is changing. Investigators increasingly want **full control** over their data, systems, and operational decisions. Yet many commonly used electronic data capture (EDC) systems create **vendor dependency**: expensive licenses, proprietary data formats, and the uncomfortable reality that your system operates at the pleasure of your vendor.

This post documents **ZZedc**, an open-source, investigator-owned EDC platform designed with a different philosophy. ZZedc runs on infrastructure you control, uses standard databases and formats, costs a fraction of commercial EDC systems, and—most importantly—can be deployed and managed by your research team without ongoing dependency on any biostatistics lab or commercial vendor.

## What This Post Covers

- **The independence problem:** Why control matters in clinical research
- **ZZedc overview:** What it is and how it differs from commercial EDC systems
- **Deployment paths:** From a single investigator's laptop to multi-site trials on AWS
- **Technical architecture:** How ZZedc achieves simplicity and security
- **Getting started:** Step-by-step guides for different deployment scenarios
- **Long-term sustainability:** Ongoing maintenance, migration, and data ownership

# The Independence Problem

## Why Investigator Control Matters

Clinical researchers routinely face uncomfortable situations with EDC systems:

**Vendor dependency**: Your study relies on continued vendor support. If the company changes pricing, goes out of business, or decides to discontinue support, you're stuck.

**Data ownership ambiguity**: Proprietary data formats mean your data isn't truly "yours." Exporting data can be expensive, slow, or impossible without vendor cooperation.

**Operational constraints**: You can't customize validation rules, reports, or workflows without vendor professional services (and associated costs).

**Security concerns**: Your patient data sits on vendor infrastructure. You don't control security, backup locations, or data residency.

**Cost escalation**: EDC licensing grows with patient volume. A system that costs $20K/year at baseline often costs $50K+ by study completion.

## Common Scenarios Where Investigators Break Free

In practice, these situations drive investigators to seek alternatives:

**Collaboration breakup**: A productive collaboration with a biostatistics lab ends due to cost disagreements or service level mismatches. The investigator is left with data trapped in a vendor system.

**Study expansion**: A pilot study is successful and scales to multi-site. Existing EDC licensing becomes prohibitively expensive. The investigator needs a more scalable approach.

**Regulatory concerns**: The investigator's institution requires data to be stored in a specific location or under specific security controls that the vendor can't accommodate.

**Long-term stewardship**: The study becomes long-term follow-up. Vendor relationship doesn't last 5+ years, but the investigator must maintain the system and data indefinitely.

**Methodological evolution**: As analysis evolves, the investigator needs flexible validation rules, custom reports, and integration with analysis tools. The vendor system feels restrictive.

## Existing Solutions Have Limitations

| Solution | Advantage | Limitation |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Commercial EDC (REDCap, Medidata) | Polished interface, vendor support | High cost, vendor lock-in, data ownership questions |
| Spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets) | Familiar, free | No validation, poor audit trail, compliance issues |
| Homebrew databases (Access, FileMaker) | Customizable | No security, poor scalability, compliance nightmare |
| Custom R/Shiny apps | Completely flexible | Requires skilled programmer, no pre-built features |
| **ZZedc** | **Open source, low cost, independent** | **Requires basic technical setup** |

# Introducing ZZedc

ZZedc is a **modern, open-source electronic data capture system** built with R and Shiny. It's specifically designed for investigator ownership and independence.

## Core Design Philosophy

**Investigator-centered**: Every design decision prioritizes your control. You own the data, the system, and the infrastructure.

**Cloud-native but independent**: Deploy on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or local servers. You choose the infrastructure provider based on cost and compliance needs.

**Security and compliance by default**: GDPR and 21 CFR Part 11 compliance frameworks built in. Data encryption, audit trails, and electronic signatures are standard features.

**Open source, not proprietary**: Source code is available on GitHub. If you need customization, you can do it yourself or hire any consultant—you're not locked into the vendor.

**Standards-based**: SQLite databases, YAML configuration, standard web technologies. If you need to migrate away, your data is in standard formats.

## What ZZedc Includes

**Electronic data capture with real-time validation**: Enter study data with immediate field-level validation. No waiting for data manager review.

**Role-based access control**: Five built-in roles (Admin, PI, Coordinator, Data Manager, Monitor) with configurable permissions.

**Comprehensive reporting**: Basic enrollment reports, quality control summaries, and statistical overviews—all built-in, no custom programming.

**Data quality framework**: Automated checks for missing data, outliers, and consistency across visits. Nightly QC runs identify issues early.

**Audit trail and compliance**: Every action is logged with user, timestamp, and change history. Electronic signatures supported for regulatory studies.

**Data export and analysis**: Export to CSV, Excel, SPSS, or R. Integrate with your preferred analysis tool directly.

**User-friendly admin interface**: Create users, manage backups, view audit logs—all from the web interface. No command-line expertise required.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key design points:**

- **All infrastructure is standard**: Docker containers, standard web server (Caddy), open-source database (SQLite)
- **No proprietary components**: You're not dependent on any vendor-specific technology
- **Transparent processes**: You can see, audit, and modify every part of the system
- **Portable data**: Your data is in SQLite—you can access it with any SQL tool, analyze it with any tool, migrate it anywhere

## Deployment Paths: Flexibility for Different Needs

ZZedc supports multiple deployment approaches, depending on your scale and technical resources:

### Path 1: Solo Researcher (Local Laptop)
**Best for:** Individual investigators, small pilot studies, initial prototyping

Install on your personal laptop in 10 minutes:
```r
# 1. Install ZZedc package from CRAN
install.packages("zzedc")

# 2. Initialize project with interactive setup
library(zzedc)
zzedc::init()  # Answers 15 simple questions

# 3. Launch
launch_zzedc()
# Application opens in browser at http://localhost:3838
```

Data lives in a local SQLite file (`data/zzedc.db`). You're the only user. Backup by copying the file to cloud storage.

**Cost**: Free (only your laptop electricity)
**Maintenance**: Minimal (you run it when needed)

### Path 2: Team Research (Single AWS Server)
**Best for:** Research team at single institution, collaborative multi-site trial

Deploy on AWS EC2 in ~15 minutes:
```bash
# 1. Install AWS CLI, configure credentials

# 2. Run deployment script
./aws_setup.sh \
  --region us-west-2 \
  --study-name "Depression Treatment Trial" \
  --study-id "DEPR-2025-001" \
  --admin-password "SecurePass123!" \
  --domain trial.example.org \
  --instance-type t3.medium
```

Application runs on AWS infrastructure. Multiple team members access via HTTPS. Database backed up automatically.

**Cost**: ~$30-50/month for EC2 instance (or less, depending on size)
**Maintenance**: Basic (Docker handles updates, Caddy handles HTTPS renewal)

### Path 3: Enterprise/Multi-Site
**Best for:** Large NIH-funded studies, pharmaceutical trials, production deployments

Deploy across multiple AWS availability zones with load balancing, RDS database, S3 backup, CloudWatch monitoring.

**Cost**: $200-500/month depending on data volume
**Maintenance**: Automated (infrastructure-as-code, CI/CD pipeline)

## Security and Compliance

ZZedc includes security and compliance frameworks that commercial EDC systems charge extra for:

**GDPR Compliance**:
- Data subject rights portal (access your data, request deletion)
- Purpose limitation (users only see data they need)
- Audit trail of all access

**21 CFR Part 11 (FDA)**:
- Electronic signatures with role-based authorization
- Immutable audit trail with hash chaining
- System validation framework

**Security Baseline**:
- Password encryption with configurable salt
- HTTPS with automatic Let's Encrypt certificates
- Role-based access control
- Session timeout and concurrent login limits

# Deployment Scenarios and Examples

## Scenario 1: Solo Researcher Prototype

**Dr. Jane is a clinical psychologist** planning a small depression treatment study. She wants to test intervention feasibility before seeking NIH funding.

**Her approach:**
```r
# Install on her laptop
install.packages("zzedc")
library(zzedc)

# Quick setup (5 minutes of questions)
zzedc::init()
# - Study name: "Depression CBT Pilot"
# - Target enrollment: 20
# - Admin username: jane_smith
# - Password: (secure password)

# Launch
launch_zzedc()
# App opens at http://localhost:3838
```

**Result**: Jane has a secure, validated EDC system running locally. She can:
- Create forms for baseline, weekly, and endpoint visits
- Enroll patients and enter data
- Generate enrollment reports
- Export data to Excel for analysis
- Back up by copying a single file to Dropbox

**Cost**: $0
**Timeline**: 15 minutes from zero to collecting data

---

## Scenario 2: Multi-Site Trial Migration

**The ADHD research consortium** at 5 universities currently uses an expensive commercial EDC that costs $40K/year and is inflexible. They want to migrate to something more affordable and customizable.

**Their approach:**
```bash
# IT staff deploys to AWS
./aws_setup.sh \
  --region us-west-2 \
  --study-name "Multisite ADHD Trial" \
  --study-id "ADHD-MULTI-2025" \
  --admin-password "SecurePassword123!" \
  --domain adhd-trial.org \
  --instance-type t3.large  # Larger instance for multi-site
```

**Result**:
- Single centralized instance accessible from all 5 sites
- HTTPS with automatic security certificates
- Role-based access: 2 administrators, 5 principal investigators, 20 coordinators, 5 data managers
- Data shared securely across institutions
- Monthly cost: $40 (95% cheaper than commercial EDC)

**Cost**: $40/month infrastructure + staff time for administration
**Timeline**: 1 week from decision to enrollment opened

---

## Scenario 3: Individual Investigator Independence

**Dr. Robert** was running a study with a local Biostatistics Lab that managed his EDC. The lab relationship deteriorated due to cost escalation and support issues. He wants to take control.

**The situation**:
- His data is in a commercial EDC (vendor owns the data format)
- Migration would cost $20K to export and reformat
- He needs a system that's independent from any vendor
- He has basic IT skills but doesn't want to manage Linux servers

**His solution**:
1. **Deploy ZZedc independently** on AWS (not through the Biostatistics Lab)
   ```bash
   ./aws_setup.sh --region us-west-1 --study-name "Robert's Study" \
     --study-id "ROBERT-2025" --domain robert-study.org
   ```

2. **Migrate his data** from the old system to ZZedc
   - Old system exports to CSV
   - CSV imported into ZZedc
   - Data is now in standard SQLite format

3. **Complete his study independently**
   - Data entry continues in ZZedc
   - Analysis done with R/Python (direct database access)
   - Final data archived as standard database file

4. **End of study**
   - Data archived in standard SQLite format to institutional repository
   - System shut down (delete EC2 instance)
   - Ongoing data access requires only free SQLite tools

**Result**: Dr. Robert owns his data and system. If he wants to work with another Biostatistics Lab in the future, he can—without vendor lock-in.
